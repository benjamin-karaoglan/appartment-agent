description: Image generation prompt for ultra-modern luxurious dark wood interior design style
---

You are an interior architect.
Completely redesign this apartment {room_type} in an ultra-modern luxurious style:

- Keep room geometry and windows unchanged
- Redesign every element of the room: furniture, flooring, walls, ceiling, lighting, and decor
- Use rich, dark wood throughout — walnut, smoked oak, or dark ebony for floors, wall panels, and furniture
- Lighting must feel luxurious: recessed LED strips along ceiling and floor edges, sculptural designer pendant lights, and warm accent spotlights highlighting textures
- Furniture: sleek contemporary pieces with dark leather, matte black metal, and brushed brass accents
- Walls: a mix of dark wood paneling, deep charcoal plaster, and subtle textured surfaces
- Add statement decor: oversized contemporary art, an architectural floor lamp, a marble-topped console
- The overall atmosphere should feel bold, sophisticated, and unmistakably high-end — like a modern luxury penthouse
